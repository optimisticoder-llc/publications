## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to **PingPolls**, where decision-making is fast, transparent, and scientifically precise. Our **Certiscore Method** works by combining pairwise preference ranking, psychophysical modeling, and **Certainty Scores**. With Certiscore, we not only measure *what you prefer* but also *how confident you are*—and now we go further with **suggestive recommendations** powered by majority votes.

This means:

* Smarter pair selection,
* Fewer comparisons (as little as **n – 1 picks**),
* Instant suggestions for priority rankers,
* Richer insights with head-to-head probabilities.

## 📈 The Science of Preferences

The Certiscore Method integrates **graph theory**, **reaction-time analysis**, and **majority-vote heuristics** to deliver accurate, efficient rankings.

### Pairwise Comparisons & Transitive Reduction

When you choose one item (A) over another (B), we record this as a directed edge (A → B). Using **transitive reduction**, we infer indirect preferences (A > B and B > C implies A > C). This minimizes redundant comparisons.

* **Classic Cost:** For $ n $ items, full pairwise requires $ C(n,2) = \tfrac{n(n-1)}{2} $.
* **Average case:** ~44% of $ C(n,2) $ at $ n=15 $.
* **Certiscore Upgrade:** With suggestive recommendations, **priority rankers can resolve preferences in as little as $n-1$ steps**—a near-linear effort instead of quadratic.

## 🧮 Certainty Scores

Certiscore quantifies how confident a decision is, based on **reaction time**:

1. **Reaction Time Normalization (Weber–Fechner Law):**
   Log-scaling keeps proportional differences meaningful (e.g., 500ms vs 1000ms).

   $$
   t_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\log(t + c) - \log(t_{\min} + c)}{\log(t_{\max} + c) - \log(t_{\min} + c)}
   $$

2. **Certainty Score (wₜ):**

   $$
   w_t = e^{-1.5 \cdot t_{\text{norm}}}
   $$

   * Fast decisions → high $ w\_t $ → small penalty.
   * Slow decisions → low $ w\_t $ → larger penalty.

3. **Score Adjustment:**
   Choices are nudged toward uncertainty-aware fairness, while still keeping winners ranked above losers.

4. **Final Scaling:**
   Scores are stretched so the best = 1000, preserving relative differences.

## 🗳️ Suggestive Recommendations (New in Certiscore)

A breakthrough in the Certiscore Method is **majority-vote–based suggestions** for **priority rankers**:

* As participants make comparisons, we aggregate results dynamically.
* Once a majority preference pattern emerges, the system can *suggest the next most likely order* for remaining items.
* This allows respondents to confirm (✔️) or override (✖️) instead of answering every possible pair.
* In practice, **only n – 1 active picks may be needed**, versus $ \tbinom{n}{2} $.

This makes priority ranking **as fast as a simple ordering task**, while retaining mathematical robustness.

## 📊 Outputs & Insights

* **Ranked Scores:** Final list with Certiscore-adjusted values (scaled 0–1000).
* **Head-to-Head Probabilities:** Via Bradley–Terry:

  $$
  P(A > B) = \frac{s_A}{s_A + s_B}
  $$
* **Confidence Signals:** Faster decisions = high certainty; slower = nuanced.
* **Suggestive Completion:** Surveyors can see both confirmed answers and suggested preferences for speed.

## 🔁 Smart Pair Selection & Early Stopping

Certiscore continues to optimize comparisons by:

* Prioritizing unresolved or uncertain pairs,
* Skipping inferred relationships,
* Randomizing for balance,
* Stopping early once rankings stabilize.

---

## 👤 Privacy First

* **Anonymous IDs only.** No profiling.
* **No raw IP storage.**
* **Transparency-first.** The method is open, but implementation safeguards prevent manipulation.

---

## 📊 Benchmarking

* **Accuracy:** Consistently 100% correct order in simulations.
* **Efficiency:**

  * Classic pairwise ( $ C(n,2) $ ): 105 comparisons at $ n=15 $.
  * Average (\~44%): \~46 comparisons.
  * Certiscore (with suggestions): \~14 comparisons (≈ $ n-1 $ ).

This translates into **faster surveys** with equally robust insights.

## 🔒 Transparent Yet Powerful

We disclose the science, keep methods peer-reviewable, and protect implementation specifics. Expect:

* No dark patterns.
* No hidden data usage.
* Open whitepaper access on GitHub.
